## Project Overview

This project implements an automated smart greenhouse using an ESP32 microcontroller. The system monitors environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, light intensity, and water level. Actuators such as fans, water pumps, growth LEDs, and servo-controlled windows adjust conditions to optimize plant growth.

The system uses multitasking on ESP32 with FreeRTOS to manage real-time operations and communicates with a cloud-based Node-RED dashboard through the MQTT protocol for monitoring and remote control.

All hardware components are simulated in **Wokwi**, so no physical setup is required to test the system.

## System Architecture

The project follows a **Cyber-Physical System (CPS)** model:

**Sensors:**

- **DHT22:** Measures temperature and humidity  
- **Soil Moisture Sensor:** Measures soil moisture level  
- **Ultrasonic Sensor:** Measures water tank level  
- **LDR:** Measures ambient light intensity  

**Actuators:**

- **Fan:** Relay-controlled  
- **Water Pump:** Relay-controlled  
- **Growth LED:** PWM-controlled  
- **Servo Motor:** Controls greenhouse window  

**Dashboard & Communication:**

- **Node-RED dashboard** for monitoring and control  
- **MQTT protocol** for publishing/subscribing sensor data and commands

## Setup Instructions

### HiveMQ Broker

1. Create a free account on [HiveMQ](https://www.hivemq.com/?utm_source=adwords&utm_campaign=&utm_term=hive%20mq&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_tgt=kwd-1156701646538&hsa_cam=22496895017&hsa_src=g&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_kw=hive%20mq&hsa_ad=653297813212&hsa_grp=185625595384&hsa_ver=3&hsa_acc=3585854406&hsa_mt=e&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=22496895017&gbraid=0AAAAADusSG6q7OGCOkTVrC9VUQhCkS-kV&gclid=CjwKCAjw89jGBhB0EiwA2o1On16HDdhYvWlA51tcHHlOKC258SsvpQez0zkLK5WYRzRaDV0Sv-vZiBoC9XUQAvD_BwE) and obtain a broker URL, username, and password.  

### Secure MQTT Connection

2. Enable TLS and provide certificates for encrypted communication.  

### Node-RED Installation

3. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download), then install [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/local) following official instructions.
4. Run the command below in your terminal to start Node-RED:

```bash
node-red
```

5. Follow the created link for the node-red server.
6. Install **node-red-dashboard** nodes for UI widgets
7. Import the flow.json file in your flows section and deploy the flow.
  

### ESP32 Configuration

5. Flash the ESP32 code using **PlatformIO** or **Arduino IDE**.  
6. Set up your MQTT credentials and broker URL.
7. To run the code as simulated in **Wokwi**, you have to follow the instructions in the [Link](https://docs.wokwi.com/vscode/getting-started).

## Usage

- **Manual Mode:** Control actuators directly from the Node-RED dashboard.  
- **Auto Mode:** The system optimizes greenhouse conditions based on sensor inputs and predefined scenarios:

  - Fan control based on temperature and humidity  
  - Water pump activation based on soil moisture and water level  
  - Growth LED control based on ambient light  
  - Servo window control based on temperature and humidity thresholds  

- Real-time sensor data and actuator status are displayed on the dashboard and OLED display.
